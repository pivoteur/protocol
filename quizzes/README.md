# Quizzes

## `dusk` evolution

`dusk` makes close-pivot calls.

* [00](quiz00): Hi, Mom!
* [01](src/quiz01): read and parse a set of open pivots reposed on github
* [02](src/quiz02): With today's (fetched) prices, identify pivots to close
* [03](src/quiz03): Partition and aggregate the close-pivots
* [04](quiz04): Find the pivot pools; iterate over the pivot pools
* [05](quiz05): Aggregate pivot-assets by blockchain

## `dawn` evolution

`dawn` (eventually) makes open-pivot calls [WIP].

* [06](quiz06): Pool tables, ... but not billiards.
* [07](quiz07): Pool tables - open pivots = available assets

## `closer` evolution

`closer` helps me to close pivots

* [08](quiz08): Read `dusk` output

## Integration testing

* [09](src/quiz09): test that all app build, at least
