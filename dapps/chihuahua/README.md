# chihuahua

We present our first dapp in backend automation for the Pivot protocol: chihuahua

> `$ chihuahua HBAR USDC $LE_DATE`

* where `$LE_DATE` is my shell-alias to today's date

![HBAR+USDC recommendation](../../quizzes/quiz02/b_compute_close/imgs/04a-hbar-usdc.png)

Makes a close-pivot recommendation in the HBAR+USDC pivot pool on @hedera for 
a computed ROI of 32%

Not bad! Not bad! 

## Multiple recommendations

Making 1 recommendation is all well-and-good, but where the automation really 
shines when it makes multiple recommendations on a pivot pool.

![8 BTC+USDC close pivot recommendations](../../quizzes/quiz02/b_compute_close/imgs/04b-btc-usdc.png)

In this case `chihuahua` makes 8 recommendations for the BTC+USDC pivot pool – 
all at once! – saving me a hours of work.
