# chihuahua

We present our first dapp in backend automation for the Pivot protocol: chihuahua

> `$ chihuahua HBAR USDC $LE_DATE`

* where `$LE_DATE` is my shell-alias to today's date

![HBAR+USDC recommendation](../../quizzes/quiz02/b_compute_close/imgs/04a-hbar-usdc.png)

Makes a close-pivot recommendation in the HBAR+USDC pivot pool on @hedera for 
a computed ROI of 32%

Not bad! Not bad! 

## Multiple recommendations

Making 1 recommendation is all well-and-good, but where the automation really 
shines when it makes multiple recommendations on a pivot pool.

In this case `chihuahua` makes 8 recommendations for the BTC+USDC pivot pool – 
all at once! – saving me a hours of work.

## Future Work

The reason why this dapp is called `chihuahua` and not `wulf` (for the backend 
system: `baewulf`, ...GEDDIT?) is because it's very limited (a pre-pre-`wulf`, 
if you will).

FUTURE WORK: 

* automation across all pivot pools
* consolidation of all recommendations into 1 close pivot

## Rollout

Future work notwithstanding, I am rolling out `chihuahua` into my daily pivot 
arbitrage workflow, starting today, anticipating saving hours each day in my 
daily operations and maintence of the Pivot Protocol.

FIN.
